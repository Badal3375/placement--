Introduction:


This project is dedicated to helping me prepare for upcoming placement interviews by strengthening my understanding of Data Structures, Algorithms, and Mathematics. The goal is to develop problem-solving skills, master core computer science concepts, and build consistency through daily practice. I will be updating this set every day with new questions, code solutions, and detailed theory notes. This preparation not only aims to boost technical competence but also build a structured repository of concepts and problems that can be revised anytime.

Daily Progress Tracking:


Each day is organized into a separate folder such as Day1, Day2, Day3, and so on. Within each folder, I include one or more solved coding questions and a markdown file explaining the concept or mathematical theory I studied that day. This format helps maintain clarity, encourages consistent updates, and provides an easy way to track my learning journey over time. For example, Day1 might contain problems on arrays and notes about prime number algorithms, while Day2 could focus on sorting and GCD/LCM techniques.

Folder Structure Overview:


The main directory is named placement-prep. Inside it, every day has its own subfolder named Day1, Day2, etc. Each subfolder contains files like Q1.cpp, Q2.py, or Notes.md. This modular structure ensures that the repository is clean and organized, making it easy to search for particular problems or topics when needed.

Topics Covered:


This preparation set covers three major areas. The first is Data Structures, including arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, graphs, tries, and sets. The second area is Algorithms, which spans sorting, searching, recursion, backtracking, dynamic programming, greedy methods, divide-and-conquer, and graph traversal techniques like BFS and DFS. The third area is Mathematics, which includes number theory, prime number generation (like Sieve of Eratosthenes), greatest common divisor (GCD), least common multiple (LCM), modular arithmetic, combinatorics (permutations and combinations), bitwise operations, and basic probability.

Goals and Approach:


The ultimate goal of this initiative is to be thoroughly prepared for technical interviews at companies like TCS, Infosys, Accenture, Wipro, Amazon, and other tech firms. To achieve this, I aim to solve at least two problems daily and write a detailed explanation of one concept or algorithm. I emphasize understanding the logic behind each solution rather than just memorizing patterns. Every problem I solve is accompanied by comments and explanations to reinforce long-term retention. With consistency, clarity, and commitment, this repository will serve as a personal learning journal and revision guide.

Tools and Platforms Used:
I mainly use programming languages like C++ and Python for solving problems. The platforms I rely on for practicing include LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, Codeforces, and InterviewBit. I use VS Code as my code editor and Markdown files to document theory and concepts. This combination ensures productivity, readability, and ease of sharing.

Final Note:
This repository is built for my own structured learning, but I welcome anyone who wants to use it for their own preparation. You can fork or clone this project and use the same day-wise format. If you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to connect. Letâ€™s make placement preparation more organized, practical, and consistent.
